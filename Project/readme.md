## Business Problem
#### To understand what factors determine the level of damage to an aircraft given a case of collision between wildlife and aircraft. To be able to predict the cost of repair / overall cost incurred by the US Civil Avaiation Industry after such a collision 

## EDA Findings
#### - The relationship between the number of strikes and the cost incurred is somewhat directly propotional
#### - Cases of strikes are significantly high when struck by small birds as compared to medium and large sized birds
#### - Most of the strikes happen during the approach phase of flight in a distance less than 40 Nautical miles from the airport
#### - Flights have more cases of collisions during the day and night times as compared to dusk and dawn
#### - Damages requiring Major Repairs or Replacement of Parts count for almost 72.5% of the cost that is incurred by the US Civil Aviation Industry
#### - The highest number of strikes is reported between the months of July and October followed by a peak in the month of May for every year.
#### - There is a sharp dip in the number of cases reported in 2020, possibly due to lesser number of flights running during the pandemic.
#### - The number of reported cases has been almost persistently increasing over the years
#### - Contrary to this, the total cost incurred in the year 2005 and 2009 was the highest crossing 700 - 800 Million dollars with 7000 to 10000 strikes reported annually as compared to less than 230 Million Dollars in the year 2019 when the number of strikes was more than 17000.
